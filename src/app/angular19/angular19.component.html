    <h2>Key Highlights of Angular 19:

        Standalone Components by Default: Angular 19 makes standalone components the default, simplifying project structures by eliminating the need for NgModules in many scenarios. This change streamlines the development process and enhances modularity. ​

        Incremental Hydration: This feature allows for the selective hydration of specific parts of a template using the Ddefer block, leading to faster initial page loads and improved interactivity, especially beneficial for server-side rendering (SSR) applications. ​

        Route-Level Render Mode: Developers can now specify the rendering mode (server-side, client-side, or prerendered) for each route, offering fine-grained control over how different routes are handled during the SSR process, thus enhancing performance and flexibility. ​

        Enhanced Reactivity with Signals: Angular 19 introduces new reactive primitives like linkedSignal and the resource API, providing more powerful tools for managing reactivity within applications. ​

        TypeScript 5.6 Support: The framework now supports TypeScript 5.6, allowing developers to utilize the latest TypeScript features in their Angular applications. ​

        ECMAScript Modules (ESM) Only Builds: Angular 19 moves to ESM-only builds, dropping CommonJS support, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and improved tree-shaking capabilities. ​
